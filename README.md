# cds - C data structures
(or Crazy Drunken Sailor)
Simple C library with basic data structure implementations.
I am not trying to reinvent the wheel. The goal is to learn how to apply theoretical concepts.

I've decided to implement and use my own linear memory allocator for 2 reasons:
* Most data structures can be implemented using a contiguous chunk of memory 
* Nice for managing the collection lifetimes
* It is relatively easy to implement

### Current Features:
TBD

### Possible improvements:
- Multithreaded Data Structures
- Other types of memory allocators

## Instructions:
TBD
